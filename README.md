# Streaming Journey

This is my journey in experimenting and finding solutions for common problems in 
making an online live church service streaming from linux.

My desire is to document what i've found and share it with the world,
to help others with my solutions and findings.

**This documentation is work in progress, I'm not even sure of its final structure yet.**

Not just feel free, but **please open PR's or issues** if you have any comments or improvements!

# Preparing before streaming
This is my checklist before streaming

 * Check media sound levels & eq: Will they be too loud or silent? Fix them beforehand.
