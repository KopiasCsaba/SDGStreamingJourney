# Tips and tricks
 * If you need to play multiple things from vlc, set up a playlist.
    * If you need to put breaks into it, add an empty audio or video file. Be careful, if you were playing videos and used window capturing, you might want to add the video file,
    as the audio file will change vlc's layout upon playing.
        * add a [3h long silent audio file](resources/------blank----.ogg) 
        * add a [2h long silent black video file](resources/------blank----.mkv) :)

# Preparing before streaming
This is my checklist before streaming
 * Get the participants in at least half hour earlier
 * Check media sound levels & eq: Will they be too loud or silent? Fix them beforehand.
 * Check live streaming & video quality before
